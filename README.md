[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/account-verification-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/account-verification-node)

When a new user signs up for your application, you want to make sure their contact information is accurate. You also like to have some assurance they are in fact a human being! You want to make sure that every new user account in your system is an actual person you can serve.
